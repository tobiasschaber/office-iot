# How to start

go to aws/terraform folder and run
terraform apply

# if you want to use kibana, do this after terraform finished:
go to aws/kibana
./postSetupElasticsearch.sh (maybe you need to adjust the endpoint url at 2 places)
import the three export_* files into kibana via kibana UI

# Please Note

Currently there is a resource type missing in terraform, thus you need to adjust the IOT rule which is created.

Under "IOT Core" -> "Act" -> motionEventForwarder, you need to
    - enable the rule
    - add a new action "DynamoDB / Split message into multiple columns of a database table (DynamoDB Version 2)" with
      the following parameters:
        - Tabel name: motions
        - IAM Role: motions_table_update_role (click apply)
